# write-my-own-git

In this repository I attempt to create my own simple version control system, like git, following the guidelines of the [wyag tutorial](https://wyag.thb.lt/).

This repo will help me better understand how git actually works, make it simpler for me to use it everyday, while also practicing my python programming skills.

I will also be using git to save my version control sytem, which makes it even more interesting. I could even use my version control system to build a git in another language and recursively continue this pattern :) ...
